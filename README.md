### Plugin release + catalog sync

Reusable release workflow: [`.github/workflows/release-plugin.yml`](.github/workflows/release-plugin.yml)

Each plugin repo tags `v*` (or runs **Release** manually). That builds a zip with `INSTALL.txt`, publishes a GitHub Release, and opens a PR on [fugs-plugins](https://github.com/SpaceFoon/fugs-plugins) to bump catalog `version` / `updatedAt` / `releaseZipUrl`.

Full setup (secret `FUGS_SITE_SYNC_TOKEN`, caller template): **[docs/RELEASE-CI.md](docs/RELEASE-CI.md)**.
